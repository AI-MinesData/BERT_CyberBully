      "I'm shaking with anger as I write this. Yesterday, on February 16, 2025, our campus lost a beautiful soul. Prakriti Lamsal, a fellow Nepali student, took her own life in her hostel room at QC 4. And you know what's worse? This could have been prevented if our so-called \"prestigious\" KIIT University actually gave a damn about its students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me break it down for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prakriti was being harassed, molested, and abused by a guy named Adhvik Srivastav. There's even a leaked audio clip where he's calling her horrible names and torturing her mentally. It's so bad that it would make even the devil ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. She begged for help. She went to the International Relations Office near the central library about a month ago. And what did they do? Nothing. They treated it like it was just another complaint about bad mess food. Are you kidding me?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Yesterday, while everyone was enjoying the KIIT Fest concert, Prakriti couldn't take it anymore. She ended her life. And that coward Adhvik? He tried to flee the city. His flight ticket was cancelled only after we protested for hours in front of the IR Office and the Vice Chancellor.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Now, the college is in full cover-up mode. They're trying to suppress everything. But we won't let them. We broke the gates of QC in protest. Yeah, it got violent, but what else were we supposed to do when they won't listen?\n",
      "\n",
      "5. And get this - there's a video of the QC 4 warden blaming us girls for the protests. She had the audacity to say things like, \"You're not safe here, go and stay in your country.\" Is this how India treats international students? Are we not welcome here?\n",
      "\n",
      "6. It gets worse. Today, on February 17, they're kicking out all Nepali students from the hostels. The guys were thrown out without notice, forced to sign out, and dumped at the railway station like garbage. No tickets, no preparation, nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. They're threatening us, beating students who question them, and leaving us homeless. The lady warden is telling us to pack our bags and leave \"respectfully\" or face consequences from higher authorities and police.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The college has locked us in our hostels so we can't talk to the media. They're disbanding our groups, blocking our attempts to organize a justice walk. Everyone's scared to speak up now, fearing expulsion.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. And you know what our esteemed founder said? That this is \"common in college\" and \"just another day.\" Are you freaking kidding me? A student DIED!\n",

      "And to the KIIT authorities - shame on you. Your negligence cost a life. Your actions after the fact show just how little you care about us. We won't forget this, and we won't let you forget either.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not over. We will fight for Prakriti, for ourselves, and for every student who comes after us. KIIT, your days of sweeping problems under the rug are over. We demand justice, and we will get it.\n",

All the Nepali students, who want to study abroad, consider iits or top private like bits, otherwise just go to Europe or America. I myself cant live in this country anymore. I feel like most of the racism against us is justified. Also, honestly, I have no hope from our retarted judicial system that justice will be served. RIP Prakriti, i just dont know what to say at this point, I will pray that you will get justice...

You will not find a single indian who support this behaviour. On the other hand, law and order authorities have arrested the accused and have started the inquiry. Dont forget india has more than a billion people. You just can't generalise the whole country based on few assholes. A lot of people in India respect people from our neighbouring countries, but unfortunately it is the hate which spreads faster. \n",

Unfortunately these types of incident and this behaviour over it has become pretty common in the country. Moreover we Indian students too hate how the system works and can't do shit about it.
